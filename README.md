# curiousMoon

This project contains my personal solutions to the exercises and questions in the book: 

### "A Curious Moon" by Rob Conery


**THIS IS NOT MY BOOK!!!** 

Just my unchecked version of the solutions to the exercises.

Most of the code is SQL. 

There's a little bit of fun with MAKEFILE and I set up a PostgreSQL database on my personal machine.

I followed along with the story and played around with the code in the text.
